# odin-paper-rock-scissors

I was tasked with building a "Paper, rock, scissors" script, and halfway through I thought I'd have some fun actually building a little web app and styling it as one my favourite videogames - Dark Souls!

It was a fun little project, I especially enjoyed creating the "won" or "lost" animation functions.

The most important part was, when I finished, taking a look at it and refactoring repeating code instances in to reusable, dynamic functions.

There is still some work to do, some styling needs to be fixed and responsiveness. I'm also considering refactoring the js some more.
